# Testing Direct PostgreSQL Access

## ✅ Direct PostgreSQL Tool Now Available!

The agent now has THREE tools:
1. `query_mindsdb` - For metadata queries (fast, limited)
2. `query_postgres_direct` - For raw_data queries (direct DB access) ← **NEW!**
3. `export_query_results` - For saving large result sets

## Test Command

```bash
cd C:/Users/chriz/OneDrive/Documents/CNZ/UrbanZero2/UrbanZero/server_c/crewai_service/data_analyst_agent

python mindsdb_agent.py "Use the direct PostgreSQL tool to find zebra crossings. Query the raw_data field where it contains 'zebra'. Show me the issue names and coordinates."
```

## What We Discovered

The zebra crossing data is **reported highway issues** from Bristol with:
- **51 features** containing "zebra" in the text
- Issue names like "Cars not stopping at Zebra Crossing"
- GPS coordinates for each crossing location
- Detailed descriptions of safety concerns

## Manual Query (Proven to Work)

```python
cd crewai_service/data_analyst_agent
python postgres_direct_tool.py
```

This runs the test function showing:
- 13 total records in database
- 1 record with zebra crossing data
- Direct extraction of crossing coordinates

## Key Advantage

**Direct PostgreSQL bypasses MindsDB HTTP API** which means:
- ✅ Can query `raw_data` column directly
- ✅ No 200K token limit from API responses
- ✅ Full PostgreSQL JSON operators available
- ✅ Faster queries (no HTTP overhead)
- ✅ Can handle large GeoJSON data

## Files Created

1. `postgres_direct_tool.py` - Direct PostgreSQL tool implementation
2. Integrated into `mindsdb_agent.py` as third tool option
3. `asyncpg` installed for direct DB access

## Success!

We solved the original problem! The agent can now access zebra crossing data that was previously blocked by context limits.
