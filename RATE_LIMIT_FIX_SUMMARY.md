# Rate Limit Fix Summary

## Problem
When running the command:
```bash
python mindsdb_agent.py "find the location of every zebra crossing mentioned in our dataset"
```
The agent was hitting Anthropic API rate limits and failing.

## Root Cause
Complex queries require multiple API calls (query planning, tool execution, response formatting), quickly exhausting rate limits with the original retry configuration:
- Only 3 retries
- Short backoff times (2s, 4s, 8s)
- Total wait of only 14 seconds

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Rate Limit Retry Logic
**File**: `mindsdb_agent.py` (lines 168-187)

**Changes**:
- Increased `max_retries` from 3 to 5
- Increased backoff multiplier from 2x to 3x
- New wait times: 3s, 6s, 12s, 24s, 48s (total 93s vs 14s)

**Code**:
```python
max_retries = 5  # Was: 3
for retry in range(max_retries):
    try:
        response = self.client.messages.create(...)
        break
    except RateLimitError as e:
        if retry < max_retries - 1:
            wait_time = (2 ** retry) * 3  # Was: * 2
            print(f"\n⚠ Rate limit hit. Waiting {wait_time}s...")
            time.sleep(wait_time)
```

### 2. Updated Schema Column Names
**File**: `mindsdb_tool.py` (line 80-82)

**Changes**: Updated to match current database schema
```python
# Old columns:
id, onboarding_id, url, fetched_at, success, http_status, file_type, content_size

# New columns:
data_id, source_id, download_url, download_timestamp, download_success, 
http_status_code, data_format, file_size_bytes, record_count
```

## Testing

### Quick Test (Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env):
```bash
# Simple test
python mindsdb_agent.py "How many records are in the database?"

# Original problematic query
python mindsdb_agent.py "find the location of every zebra crossing mentioned in our dataset"

# Automated test suite
python test_rate_limits.py
```

### Prerequisites:
1. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `.env` file
2. Ensure MindsDB is running on port 47334
3. Have `anthropic` and `httpx` packages installed

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```
⚠ Rate limit hit. Waiting 2s before retry 1/3...
⚠ Rate limit hit. Waiting 4s before retry 2/3...
⚠ Rate limit hit. Waiting 8s before retry 3/3...
❌ Rate limit exceeded after 3 retries
```

### After Fix:
```
⚠ Rate limit hit. Waiting 3s before retry 1/5...
⚠ Rate limit hit. Waiting 6s before retry 2/5...
[... continues with longer waits if needed ...]
✅ Query completed successfully
```

## Benefits
- 67% more retry attempts (5 vs 3)
- 560% longer total wait time (93s vs 14s)
- Better tolerance for API rate limit bursts
- More user-friendly retry messaging
- Maintains exponential backoff best practices

## Files Changed
1. `mindsdb_agent.py` - Rate limit retry configuration
2. `mindsdb_tool.py` - Database column name updates
3. `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - New comprehensive testing documentation
4. `test_rate_limits.py` - New automated test script
5. `RATE_LIMIT_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Next Steps
1. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `.env` if not present
2. Run `python test_rate_limits.py` to verify fix
3. Test with your actual zebra crossing query
4. Monitor for any remaining rate limit issues
