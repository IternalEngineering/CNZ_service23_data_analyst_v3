# Improved Rate Limit Configuration

## Current Configuration (lines 168-169):
max_retries = 3
wait_time = (2 ** retry) * 2  # 2s, 4s, 8s (total: 14s)

## Proposed Configuration:
max_retries = 5
wait_time = (2 ** retry) * 3  # 3s, 6s, 12s, 24s, 48s (total: 93s)

## Rationale:
- More retries (5 instead of 3) for transient rate limit issues
- Longer backoff multiplier (3x instead of 2x) to give API time to reset
- Total wait time increases from 14s to 93s before giving up
- This should handle most rate limit scenarios
